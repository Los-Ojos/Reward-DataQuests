I was wondering if I might have a few minutes of your time. I have a matter I need some help with. Unfortunately I have been unable to find anyone to help me so far.\\n\\nUntil a few years ago, I was a scout for the Defenders of Albion. I spent my time out in the Frontiers, looking for invaders from Midgard and Hibernia. Because of my skills, I was chosen to lead a group of Defenders in an attack on Dun nGed Watchtower. While the attack was a success and we took the tower, I barely survived.\\n\\nA stray arrow from a Hibernian ranger just missed my heart. I was brought back to Castle Sauvage where I was healed enough to travel here to Cotswold Village. Once I recovered, I asked to leave the Defenders. My superiors agreed to let me go, but asked if I would continue to help them in any way I could.\\n\\nThey were in need of good arrows for their scouts, since the scouts on in the Frontiers rarely have time to make their own arrows. I agreed and the Defenders set up a nice little shop for me here. Between them and the residents of Cotswold, I barely have time to keep up with their demands. That\'s where you can help me.\\n\\nI am running low on supplies for making my special arrows for the Defenders. They are slightly different than the ones I sell, so I can\'t just get the supplies anywhere. If you have some time, I would be willing to pay you to retrieve some supplies for me. Are you interested?', 'Samwell Hornly needs your help to get the supplies she needs. Find the decaying zombies and obtain two bundles of legs from them.

I shall make sure that the Defenders know that you are a loyal subject of Albion. Now, let\'s not waste any time. I have many arrow heads and feathers for the shaft, but I am low on the shafts themselves.\\n\\nI have tried many different things for the shafts in my attempt to make special arrows for the Defenders. Surprisingly, the leg bones of decayed zombies seem to make lightweight but strong shafts for arrows. If you can bring me two bundles of decayed zombie legs, you will be helping me out quite a bit.\\n\\nTo find the decaying zombies, leave this building and head south to the river. Follow the bank of the river south, taking care to avoid the river sprites. There is a graveyard along the river, south of here. You\'ll find the decayed zombies there as well as on the hill northeast of the graveyard.
