# Reward-DataQuests
SQL inserts for reward dataquests for the 1.124 DOL repo

## Usage
Copy the SQL inserts and run them against your database to add them.

## Contributing
If you are familiar with the database structure for the reward quests, feel free to contribute your quests here. If the quest requires new NPC's/items/objects (that are not in the Eve of Darkness public DB) be sure to add the SQL inserts for them too. It's recommended to use the DOLToolbox fork found here at Los Ojos as the quest builder form has been updated for this style of dataquests and will enforce the correct database structure for these quests to work.
